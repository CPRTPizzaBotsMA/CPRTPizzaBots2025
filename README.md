# CPRTPizzaBots
We've designed a robot that can carry pizza by using components such as a plate, wheels, motors, an Arduino with a motor shield, a battery pack, a color sensor, and a glue gun.  
We will apply mechatronics concepts like assembly, wiring, and programming to make the robot move and complete its task.
